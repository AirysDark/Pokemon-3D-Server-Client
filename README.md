How to Build?

1. Do a nuget restore first. (That should resolve missing dependency.)
2. Build using Visual Studio 2015 / Mono whichever you prefer.

Please make sure that you have the latest version of the compiler for the build to success.
The compiler should be able to process c# 6.0 and produce an exe.

If there are any problems, do approach jianmingyong (http://pokemon3d.net/forum/members/30945/) and I will sort things out.

Compatibility:

1. Windows 7 / Vista / 8 / 8.1 / 10
